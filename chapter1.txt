Git add chapter1.txt // use this to add the chapter1 into git repository
Git commit -m "first commit" // to commit out of staging area
Git status // to check the file in staging area
Git log // checking the log in what have been committed to repository 
Git diff chapter3.txt // checking what have been changed to the file
Git checkout chapter3.txt // revert the file back to the previous version at the last checkpoint that has been committed
